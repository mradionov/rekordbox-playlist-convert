# rekordbox-playlist-convert

A script to convert Rekordbox playlist collection to something that can be exported to USB.

Most forums suggest to use MP3 to be sure that all DJ controllers support it, but most of my collection is in FLAC and
my Rekordbox couldn't export FLAC directly to USB.

### Install

1. fetch this repo from GitHub
2. `cd rekordbox-playlist-convert/`
3. `npm install`
